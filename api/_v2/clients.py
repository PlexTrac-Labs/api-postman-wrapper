The role is the level of access a user will be assigned for the client being added to. This can differ from the default role a user is assigned.

For example: A user can have the _Analyst_ role assigned as the default role that will be apply to all clients they have access to. They can then be assigned the _Standard User_ role for a certain client, adding thee extra permissions when inside that specific client.

The "role" field must contain the RBAC role code. The codes for the default roles are:

Administrator - `ADMIN`

Standard User - `STD_USER`

Analyst - `ANALYST`

A custom RBAC role will have a role code created in the format

Custom Role - `TENANT_0_ROLE_CUSTOM_ROLE`

The rest of the fields should match the values of the existing user.
