    This request **adds users** to a specific repository in the **NarrativesDB** module.

Only Standard users need to be added, as Admins have access to all repositories.

When replace is set to **TRUE** the repositoryUsers list replaces the previous list. When set to **FALSE**, it acts as an upsert and will add new users or modify existing users.

For example:

*   Use replace is TRUE when one user exists who no longer needs access and two different users need to be added. If replace is set to TRUE, the final list will only contain the two new users and the first user will no longer have access.
*   Use replace is FALSE when one user currently has access and should continue access, but two more users need access. If replace is set to FALSE, the final list will contain three users.
