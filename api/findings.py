**Affected Assets**

A finding's `affected_assets` are a copy of a `client_asset` with additional affected fields. When **adding a new** asset to a finding's affected_assets, you should use the [GET Get Asset](https://api-docs.plextrac.com/#5fa9e7be-55d3-452e-8562-00ba4a137782) endpoint, then add the following keys. See our docs on the [Asset Object](https://docs.plextrac.com/plextrac-documentation/master/plextrac-api/object-structures/asset-object) structure for more details about these affected fields.

- ports
- status
- locationUrl
- vulnerableParameters
- evidence
- notes
    

Then add this modified asset object to the finding's `affected_assets` dictionary with the key being a string of the asset's `id` and the value being the modified asset object.

**Registering Tags**

When a finding is created in the UI there are a few processes that get kicked off that do not happen when calling this endpoint directly.

Any tags added to the finding that have not been added anywhere else in the instnace will be added to the finding but NOT to the list of tenant tags. This means when you start typing to add a tag anywhere in the platform, the dropdown list that pops up will not have the new tags since they weren't added to the listed of tenant tags.

**Note:**

This PUT request is meant to **replace** the finding object in the DB. Use the [GET Get Finding](https://api-docs.plextrac.com/#e903c288-8807-4df9-962f-0d86f76d9df8) endpoint to get the current finding, make necessary changes, then send that object in the payload to update the finding.

The example payloads shown here do not have all the possible properties on a finding, but only acts as an example. Each finding will be slightly different depending on what data is on the finding. Some property keys won't be added to a finding until that data is added to the finding.
